    <div id="about"> <h1>About Me</h1> 
         <p> I created the "java fox" persona as both a way to move on from my old one when I was with my ex and thus to help give myself more of an identity, as well as finalizing a goal of mine; to come up with my own brand. I love foxes and I love coffee, so while it is a pretty linear way of thinking, why not combine the two? I have been drawing my entire life but only recently(five years or so) have I begun to take it seriously.</p>
        <p>My best friend is who helped to push me to draw more (as well as my ex but we don't talk about him). She has helped motivate me to create more and see more in my art than I ever thought possible. </p>
